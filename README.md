- **[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/)** - To manage ComfyUI state

## Getting Started

### Prepare the AWS environment

For the sake of reproducability and consistency, we recommend using [Amazon SageMaker Studio Code Editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/code-editor.html) for deploying and testing this solution.

‚ÑπÔ∏è You can use your local development environment, but you will need to **make sure that you have AWS CLI, AWS CDK and Docker properly setup**.

<details>
<summary>Click to see environment estup with Amazon SageMaker Studio Code Editor</summary>

1. Launch Amazon SageMaker Studio Code Editor using CloudFormation template from link in [sagemaker-studio-code-editor-template](https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-studio-code-editor-template/). (This template launches Code Editor with some necessary capabilities including Docker, auto termination)
2. Open SageMaker Studio from url in CloudFormation Output.
3. Navigate to Code Editor from Application section in top left.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to see environment setup with Local environment</summary>

If you do not have AWS CLI, follow [AWS CLI Install Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

If you do not have CDK, follow [CDK Start Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

If you do not have Docker follow [Docker Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

If you haven't setup AWS CLI after installation, execute the following commands on your local environment:

```bash
aws configure
```

When prompted, enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and then the default region name (eg. us-east-1). You can leave the output format field as default or specify it as per your preference.
</details>

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure your account has quota for GPU instance. Go to [Service Quota](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas/L-3819A6DF) and set `All G and VT Spot Instance Requests` to at least 4.

### Deploying ComfyUI

1. (First time only) Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/cost-effective-aws-deployment-of-comfyui.git`)
2. (First time only) cd into repo directory (`cd cost-effective-aws-deployment-of-comfyui`)
3. Run `make`

Depending on your custom_nodes and extenstions in the dockerfile, the deployment will take approx. 8-10 minutes to have ComfyUI ready
 
```
 ‚úÖ  ComfyUIStack

‚ú®  Deployment time: 579.07s

Outputs:
ComfyUIStack.CognitoDomainName = comfyui-alb-auth-XXXXXXX
ComfyUIStack.Endpoint = ComfyUiALB-XXXXX.uw-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
ComfyUIStack.UserPoolId = us-west-2_XXXXXXX
Stack ARN:
arn:aws:cloudformation:[us-east-1]:[your-account-id]:stack/ComfyUIStack/[uuid]

‚ú®  Total time: 582.53s
```

You can access application from output value of `ComfyUIStack.Endpoint`.

### Uploading models

1. You can install models, loras, embedding, controlnets over ComfyUI-Manager or other extension (custom node). See [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#model-installation) for detail.
2. You can extend (optional) and execute the upload script in this repo with a preselected list of models, controlnets etc. If the SSM command is not working, make sure that the role you are using is allowed to access the EC2. You'll find some additional examples in the `/scripts/upload_models.sh` file.

```bash
# 1. SSM into EC2
aws ssm start-session --target "$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=ComfyUIStack/Host" "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].[InstanceId]' --output text)" --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION

# 2. SSH into Container
container_id=$(sudo docker container ls --format '{{.ID}} {{.Image}}' | grep 'cdk' | awk '{print $1}')
sudo docker exec -it $container_id /bin/bash

# 3. install models, loras, controlnets or whatever you need (you can also include all in a script and execute it to install)

# FACE SWAP EXAMPLE Upscaler - https://huggingface.co/ai-forever/Real-ESRGAN
wget -c https://huggingface.co/ai-forever/Real-ESRGAN/blob/main/RealESRGAN_x2.pth -P ./models/upscale_models/
```

### Access ComfyUI

The deployed solution provides an EC2 accessible through an Application Load Balancer. The Load Balancer requires authentication through Amazon Cognito User Pool. 

You may [enable self-signup](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#enable-self-sign-up), enable [SAML authentication](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#saml-authentication), or manually create user in Cognito console.

### Delete deployments and cleanup resources

For the sake of preventing data loss from accidental deletions and keeping the example as straightforward as possible, the deletion of the complete deployment and resources is semi-automated. To cleanup and remove everything you've deployed you need to do following:

1. Delete the Auto Scaling Group manually:
- Login to your AWS console
- Search for Auto Scaling Groups (EC2 featuer) in the search bar
- Select ComfyASG
- Press Actions and then delete
- Confirm deletion

2. After ASG deletion you just can run following command in your terminal. This command will delete all remaining resources, but EBS and the Cognito User pool.
```bash
npx cdk destroy
```

3. Delete EBS Volume
- Login to your AWS console
- Search Volumes (EC2 featuer) in the search bar
- Select ComfyUIVolume
- Press Actions and then delete
- Confirm deletion

4. Delete Cognito User Pool
- Login to your AWS console
- Search for Cognito in the serach bar
- Select ComfyUIuserPool..
- Press delete
- Confirm deletion

5. Delete ECR Repository
- Login to your AWS console
- Search for ECR (Elastic Container Regsitry) in the search bar
- Select comfyui
- Press delete
- Type delete to confirm deletion

## Notes and Additional Information

### Cost Estimation

This section provides cost estimations for running the application on AWS. Please note that these are rough estimations, and you should refine them based on your project's specific requirements and usage patterns.

#### Flexible Workload (Default)

For non-critical business workloads, which should apply to the majority of applications of this type, you can use Spot Instances to benefit from cost savings. Spot Instances offer an average historical discount of 71% (us-east-1, October 2024) for the `g4dn.xlarge` instance type. Additionally, you can replace the NAT Gateway with a NAT Instance to further reduce costs.

The following assumptions are made for the cost estimation:

- No services from the AWS Free Tier are included.
- Instance Type: `g4dn.xlarge` with 4 vCPU, 16 GiB memory, and 1 Nvidia T4 Tensor Core GPU (Spot Instance with 71% discount).
- 250 GB SSD storage.
- 1 Application Load Balancer.
- VPC with NAT Instance.
- Elastic Container Registry (ECR) with 10 GB of data stored per month.
- 5 GB of logging data per month.

#### Business-Critical Workload

For business-critical workloads, you can use On-Demand instances and a NAT Gateway for high availability.

The following assumptions are made for the cost estimation:

- Instance Type: `g4dn.xlarge` with 4 vCPU, 16 GiB memory, and 1 Nvidia T4 Tensor Core GPU (On-Demand pricing).
- VPC with 50 GB of data processed per NAT Gateway per month.
- Other assumptions are the same as the Flexible Workload scenario.

|--------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
